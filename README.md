## Overview

The predicted value is based on location, hotel grade, no of guests, accommodation status, venue type, day or night and wedding theme parameters. A dataset was created by collecting data according to hotels in different districts in Sri Lanka and it was used for training the model which is being used for the prediction. Linear Regression is used as the algorithm for the prediction model in this project.
